Navigate to the project directory:cd personal-task-manager
Install the dependencies:npm install
Set up environment variables:Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the base URL for your backend API:VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
(Note: The variable name must start with VITE_ if you are using Vite)Run the development server:npm run dev
The application should now be running on http://localhost:5173 (or another port if specified).üîå API IntegrationThe frontend application consumes a backend API for all its data operations. The following endpoints are used:MethodEndpointDescriptionPOST/api/auth/registerRegister a new user.POST/api/auth/loginLog in an existing user.GET/api/auth/profileGet the logged-in user's profile.GET/api/tasksFetch all tasks for the user.POST/api/tasksCreate a new task.GET/api/tasks/:idGet a single task by its ID.PUT/api/tasks/:idUpdate a task by its ID.DELETE/api/tasks/:idDelete a task by its ID.üìÅ Folder StructureThe project follows a modular and organized folder structure to keep the code clean and maintainable./src
