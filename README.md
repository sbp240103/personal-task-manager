| `POST` | `/api/auth/login`     | Log in an existing user.         |
| `GET`  | `/api/auth/profile`   | Get the logged-in user's profile.|
| `GET`  | `/api/tasks`          | Fetch all tasks for the user.    |
| `POST` | `/api/tasks`          | Create a new task.               |
| `GET`  | `/api/tasks/:id`      | Get a single task by its ID.     |
| `PUT`  | `/api/tasks/:id`      | Update a task by its ID.         |
